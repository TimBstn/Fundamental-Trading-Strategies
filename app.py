# Description Strategy

## Hypothesis
- Market does not fully incorporate historical financial information into prices in a timely manner
- Average high book to market firms (value stocks) are financially distressed resulting in declining margins, profits, cash flows
- Financial variables that reflect changes in these economic conditions should be useful in predicting future firm performance
- Annual plus in return of 7.5%  by picking these companies
- Combining with short strategy: 23%  annual return between 1976 and 1996

## Strategy
- Trade on high book to market companies (top 5 quantile) 
- Create score based on profitability, capital structure and and efficiency measures
- Long companies with high score, short companies with low score

# Description Strategy

## Hypothesis
- The predictability of abnormal returns based on information contained in past earnings announcements is a statistically and economically significant anomaly
- Stock prices do not instantaneously adjust to information in earnings announcements
- The investor irrationality and information processing cost explanations imply that the marketâ€™s earnings expectations differ from the true process generating earnings, thus creating a direct link between estimated unexpected earnings and future abnormal returns
- The return to an equally weighted portfolio consisting of long positions in extreme good news announcers and short positions in extreme bad news announcers earns +4.19% average estimated abnormal return over the 60- day post-announcement period

## Strategy
- Calculate Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) 
- Go long on top decile and short on worst decile

# Description Strategy

## Hypothesis
- Momentum is the total return of a stock (including dividends) over the last n month
- There is a tendency of rising stock prices to rise further and falling stock prices to fall further
- Investors underreact to information and overreact to past information with a delay, perhaps due to positive feedback trading
- The returns of a zero cost portfolio (long past winners and short losers) made money in every five year period since 1940

## Strategy
- Run the intermediate momentum strategy: lookback period between 3 and 12 month
- Here: n = 12 month and hold for 3 month
- Long the top decile and short the worst decile in that period

- Earnings attributable to the accrual component of the earnings exhibits lower persistence than earnings attributable to cash flow
- Firms with relatively high (low) levels of accruals experience negative (positive) future abnormal returns 

## Strategy
- Go long where the positive earnings surprise is driven by cash

- Rank companies based on accruals to assets component and categorize into deciles
- Short the first and long the last decile

# Description Strategy

## Hypothesis
- The trader profits from the correction of the divergence between two similar stocks
- Historical return correlations between pairs can lead to future information on the stocks performance
- When a firm and its peer deviate in stock prices, there is likely news related to the fundamentals of the pair and it takes time for the news to disseminate to the pair

## Strategy
- Identify pairs, which are trading instruments that show high correlations, i.e., the price of one moves in the same direction as the other
- Look for divergence in prices between a pair 
- When a divergence is noticed, take the opposite positions for instruments in a pair
- Therefore, traders take long positions for underperforming stocks and short positions for overperforming stocks
